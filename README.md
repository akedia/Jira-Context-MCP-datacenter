# Jira Context MCP

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@rahulthedevil/Jira-Context-MCP)](https://smithery.ai/server/@rahulthedevil/Jira-Context-MCP)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation for Jira that allows you to:

- Input a Jira ticket link to fetch issue details and instruct Cursor to fix it
- Retrieve all tickets assigned to you within a specified Jira project 
- Filter Jira issues based on a specific issue type and automatically direct Cursor to resolve them
- Integrate seamlessly with Jira's API for automation and efficiency
